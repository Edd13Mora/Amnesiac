# Amnesiac

`Amnesiac` is a post-exploitation framework designed to assist Penetration Testers and Red Teams with lateral movement within active directory environments.

Amnesiac was specifically developed to bridge a gap on Windows OS, where post-exploitation frameworks are not readily available unless explicitly installed.

If you find Amnesiac valuable and use it in your work, please consider giving us a star on GitHub. Your support motivates the developer to continue improving and maintaining this project.

## Key Features

### Command Execution over Named-Pipes (SMB)

Amnesiac utilizes the SMB protocol to establish secure connections with target machines. It sends commands and receives outputs through Named Pipes, ensuring discreet and efficient post-exploitation activities.

### No Installation Required

Unlike traditional frameworks, Amnesiac does not require installation on target systems. It operates entirely in memory, reducing the risk of detection and leaving no traces behind.

### User-Friendly Framework

Amnesiac is designed with usability in mind. It provides a user-friendly interface and offers a wide range of inbuilt post-exploitation modules, making it accessible and efficient for both beginners and experienced users.

### Versatile Post-Exploitation Modules

Amnesiac comes equipped with an array of post-exploitation modules, including keyloggers and Kerberos ticket dumping tools. These modules can be seamlessly integrated into your testing and assessment workflows.

### Acknowledgments

Amnesiac relies on the contributions of various projects for its underlying functionality. In the source code of each module, you'll find author and reference link information, ensuring proper attribution to the original creators.
